<h2>About this notebook</h2>

In this notebook (salw_rw.ipynb) three methods or formulas to convert salinity (ppm) to
water resistivity (Rw) are evaluated. The formulas are; one proposed by
E. R. Crain at his web site (<https://spec2000.net/00-index.htm>), one
from Bateman-Konen, and the last formula one from Kennedy. These last
two formulas are in Kennedy, D., Technical Note: The Bateman-Konen
Resistivity-Salinity Transform II, PETROPHYSICS, Vol 56, NO.4 (August
15), Pg 379-381. For control points, those in Gen-6 of the Schlumberger
(2013) Log interpretation charts, are considered effectiveness
verification of the formulas.
